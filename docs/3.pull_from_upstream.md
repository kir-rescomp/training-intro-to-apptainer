# 3. How to pull a container image from an upstream registry such as Docker hub

Docker containers ( primarily stored in https://hub.docker.com/) can be pulled as Apptainer container images. For an example, if we want to pull the latest version of Tensorflow (GPU) container provided by the Tensorflow developers 

* Search and find the container registry for TF in https://hub.docker/com. 
    * image we are after in this instance is https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/tags

* Copy tthe version you prefer with blue <kbd>Copy</kbd> button next to the corresponding tag. We will use `latest-gpu` as an example
    * It will be in the form of `docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu`
    * IN order to pull this as an apptainer, remove the word `pull` and create a URL as `docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu`
* Then pull it with `apptainer pull nameforthelocalimage.aif docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu`
    * `nameforthelocalimage.aif` is the name of the file to be saved once pulled. File extension can be anything but it is ideal to use `.aif` making it easier to idenity the container image 

!!! terminal "code"
    ```bash
    apptainer pull tensorflow-latest-gpu.aif docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
    ```
