# 1. Getting Started with Containers

!!! circle-question "Overview"
    
    **Questions**
    - What is a container and why might I want to use it?

    **Objectives**
    Understand what a container is and when you might want to use it.

## What are Containers

A container is an entity providing an isolated software environment (or filesystem) for an application and its dependencies.

If you have already used a Virtual Machine, or VM, youâ€™re actually already familiar with some of the concepts of a container.

The key difference here is that VMs virtualise hardware while containers virtualise operating systems. There are other differences (and benefits), in particular containers are:

- lighter weight to run (less CPU and memory usage, faster start-up times)
- smaller in size (thus easier to transfer and share)
- modular (possible to combine multiple containers that work together)

Since containers do not virtualise the hardware, containers must be built using the same architecture as the machine they are going to be deployed on. Containers built for one architecture cannot run on the other.

## Containers and your workflow
There are a number of reasons for using containers in your daily work:

    - Data reproducibility/provenance
    - Cross-system portability
    - Simplified collaboration
    - Simplified software dependencies and management
    - Consistent testing environment
