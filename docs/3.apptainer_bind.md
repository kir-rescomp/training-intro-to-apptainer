# 3. Apptainer Bind: Sharing Data Between Host and Container

Apptainer's bind feature allows users to map directories from the host system into the container environment. This is essential for reading or writing data, leveraging host-based filesystems, or sharing results from container jobs.​

## How Binding Works

By default, Apptainer binds your home directory and current working directory into containers. You can also specify custom bind mounts using the `--bind` flag or the environment variable `APPTAINER_BIND`.​ Our recommendation is to use the latter option to bind the full BMRC file system

- Set the `APPTAINER_BIND` variable before launching the container (useful for repeated binds).

```bash
export APPTAINER_BIND="/gpfs3/well,/gpfs3/users"
```

    We recommend adding these environment variable to your `~/.bashrc` file so they're automatically set for all future sessions

    ```bash
    echo 'export APPTAINER_BIND="/gpfs3/well,/gpfs3/users"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

!!! circle-info "Best Practices"

    - If the destination is omitted, Apptainer mounts the directory to the same path in the container (e.g., /project → /project).​

    - Paths must be absolute; relative paths are not accepted.

    - Use binds to access input/output data, reference scripts, or share results with the host system.

    - Bind mounts are a central aspect of making containers practical in HPC environments, facilitating seamless data movement between host and container
